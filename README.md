The set up process is not entirely streamlined, yet.

For now, you'll need Python (at least 3.6) and pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```
Then run the app with 
```
flask run
```

To launch the extension, go to chrome extensions, enable dev mode and load the 'extension' folder.

To-do: Upgrade repository to use with virtualenv.
